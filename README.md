# ProjectZero

Project that stemmed from a Hackathon.

**Problem**: Hiking is a popular activity in Vancouver. When hiking as a group of friends, someone generally likes to play music out loud to set a mood for the group. However, it is rude to other strangers also on the hike, and so playing music out loud is now generally prohibited / looked down upon.

**Solution**: Create an app that allows music to be shared/ streamed to other devices through BlueTooth, because many hike trails don't have internet or data connectivity.
